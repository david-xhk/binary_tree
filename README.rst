Binary Tree provides a Node object and some useful functions like constructors and traversals for a binary tree data structure.

Features
--------

- Construct a binary tree from:
    - String
    - An in-order and a pre-order traversal
    - An in-order and a post-order traversal

- Traverse a binary tree in:
    - Pre-order
    - In-order
    - Post-order
    - Level-order

- Get all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree

- Check if a tree:
    - Has a certain path sum
    - Is symmetrical
