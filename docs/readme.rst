Binary Tree
===========

binary_tree provides a Node object and some useful functions like constructors and tree traversals for a binary tree data structure.

--------
Features
--------

1. Construct a binary tree
    * Using string
    * From in-order and pre-order traversal
    * From in-order and post-order traversal

2. Traverse a binary tree  
    * Pre-order
    * In-order
    * Post-order
    * Level-order

3. Get from a binary tree
    * All root-to-leaf paths
    * The maximum depth

4. Check a binary tree
    * If it has a certain path sum
    * For symmetry
