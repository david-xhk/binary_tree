Features
--------
* Construct a binary tree from
    * String
    * An in-order and a pre-order traversal
    * An in-order and a post-order traversal

* Traverse a binary tree in
    * Pre-order
    * In-order
    * Post-order
    * Level-order

* Get all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree

* Check if a tree
    * Has a certain path sum
    * Is symmetrical
